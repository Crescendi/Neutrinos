NuMI - Neutrinos at the Main Injector
The NuMI Beamline is a facility at Fermilab, near Chicago, which uses protons 
from the Main Injector accelerator to produce an intense beam of neutrinos 
which are utilized by the MINOS Experiment; 
the neutrino beam is directed along a line connecting the two endpoints of the experiment.
