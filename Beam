NuMI - Neutrinos at the Main Injector
The NuMI Beamline is a facility at Fermilab, near Chicago, which uses protons 
from the Main Injector accelerator to produce an intense beam of neutrinos 
which are utilized by the MINOS Experiment

MINOS - Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search
The MINOS Experiment is a long-baseline neutrino experiment designed to observe the phenomena of neutrino oscillations,
an effect which is related to neutrino mass. 
MINOS uses two detectors, one located at Fermilab, at the source of the neutrinos, 
and the other located 450 miles away, in northern Minnesota, at the Soudan Underground Mine State Park in Tower-Soudan.
